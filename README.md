# lup-decomposition
Implementation of LUP decomposition to find the solution for system of linear equations of the form AX=B.

# LUP Decomposition Jupyter Notebook File
Use LUP decomposition to find the solution for system of linear equations of the form AX=B. First decompose A into L & U using
Gaussian elimination and perform LUP-SOLVE to get X. Assume number of equations is equal to number of unknowns i.e. A is of size n*n, where n is not known in advance
